    <p>HTML Entities <br>
        Some characters are reserved in HTML. <br>

        If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. <br>

            Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML <br>

            A character entity looks like this: <br>

            &entity_name;
            OR

            &#entity_number; <br><br>
            To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; <br>
                Advantage of using an entity name:
                An entity name is easy to remember. <br>
                Disadvantage of using an entity name:
                Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.</p>
